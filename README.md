# 67-272: ClassicCreamery Project - Phase 2

We will continue our project to develop a foundation for the ClassicCreamery management system in this phase. We will focus our efforts on building out the models for the three entities given to you in the this phase's ERD in `docs/creamery_erd_p2.pdf` and adding all necessary business logic. In addition, you will have to write unit tests for all models and ensure that test coverage is complete.

**Grading**

This phase will constitute 5 percent of your final course grade and is broken down into the following three components:

1. **Creation of Models**: Models for the entities listed in the ERD found in this project's `docs` directory need to be created. Also, in the `docs` directory, you are given a spec sheet on essential methods each model must have; those methods must be fully implemented. The project must be **using Rails 8.1.1 and Ruby 3.4.7**

2. **Unit Testing**: Unit tests for all methods in all models must be written and fully passing. We will check to ensure there is 100 percent code coverage for unit tests using the `simplecov` gem used in class and lab. Because `simplecov` suffers from some false positives (as mentioned in class), we may spot-check tests to ensure specific tests were included. Only the models in this phase need complete coverage. There are steep penalties for less than 100 percent coverage and no credit at all for less than 90 percent coverage.

3. **Coding Style**: All code must be appropriately organized. What that means at this stage is the following:

    - Related or similar functionality is grouped or clustered together.
    - Indentation should be used consistently to make code readable.
    - Comments showing organization should be present and explaining difficult code should be used when/if necessary.

    In addition, we expect that you will have a clean context set up and used for all testing, similar to what was done in PATS.  As mentioned in class, using this approach reduces duplication and promotes reuse (and we will take advantage of that later).  If you simply allow a gen AI tool to generate tests that are not following clean code practices, expect a substantial penalty.

**Checkpoint**

On **February 4th**, the three models must be generated using the Rails generators, the initial database created, and all the relationships between the three models must be set up and tested. In addition, the scopes for `Store` and `Employee` models must be completed and tested.

All checkpoints are due in your GitHub repository before 11:59pm EST on the date specified. We are not explicitly checking for test coverage on checkpoints, only that the specified tests exist and they pass. Checkpoints will be submitted via GitHub and Gradescope (additional instructions to follow).

**Other Notes**

1. We strongly advise you _NOT_ to use `rails generate scaffold ...` but rather `rails generate model ...` in creating your models for this phase. Scaffolding will generate lots of extra code that may inadvertently impact your test coverage and cause you to lose points. We will have no sympathy if you ignore this warning and lose points.

2. If we have installed a gem in the `Gemfile`, then use the version we've specified. The autograder depends on these particular versions of these gems, so do not add to or modify them without instructor permission.

3. The checkpoint should be considered minimum progress necessary, but students are strongly encouraged to work beyond that so that the final week of the project phase is not a miserable one.  Our advice is to follow the path but work ahead of the minimum requirements.


**Turning in Phase 2**

Your project should be turned in via your private repository on GitHub **before 11:59 pm (EST) on Sunday, February 15th, 2026**. Once it's in your repo, you will then submit it from there to Gradescope. More instructions on submitting to the autograder will be posted separately. The solution for this phase (i.e., starter code for the next phase) will be released soon after; no late assignments will be accepted after solutions are released.

Again, if you have questions regarding the turn-in of this project or problems downloading any of the materials below, please post them on Piazza or ask someone well in advance of the turn-in date. Waiting until the day before it is due to get help is unwise -- you risk not getting a timely response that close to the deadline and will not be given an extension because of such an error.
